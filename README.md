# Compilers-P1_Scanner

Chose to do option 2 and created a FSA table  (found in scanner.h)

## To run program:
1. run 'make clean' to first clean up from any previous runs
2. run 'make'
3. run ./P1 < [filename] 
    3a. ./P1 [filename] will work as well
    3b. note if you just run ./P1 the program will ask for keyboard input and you must click enter to give the scanner the EOF_tk
